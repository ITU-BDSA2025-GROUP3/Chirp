# Chirp
A twitter clone for the course Analysis, Design and Software Architecture (Autumn 2025) at IT University of Copenhagen

============ **Legal** ============

This project called Chirp by ITU-BDSA2025-GROUP3 is a university project for the
course
**Analysis, Design and Software Architecture (Autumn 2025)** of the **IT University of Copenhagen**.
This project will therefore in large part be similar to other projects from groups taking this same course, as the requirements
and weekly tasks are the same for every group. ITU-BDSA2025-GROUP3 any similarity to other projects are therefore an expression
of this.

The project depends on several other third party libraries and resources as detailed below:


- This project depends on Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft.Playwright and .NET 8, each licensed under the MIT license. A copy of the
  license can be found under the licenses folder.

- The project depends on Xunit, Identity.Core and AspNet.Security.OAuth.GitHub each licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. A copy of the license can be found in the licenses folder

- This project uses course-provided razor pages cshtml base and image assets. ITU-BDSA2025-GROUP3 does not claim ownership of these image
  assets. Razor pages have been modified by ITU-BDSA2025-GROUP3.

============ **Extra notes** ============

During the project there are several commits using a wrong co-author statemenet (See below for example). So there are quite a few commits missing proper co-authors on it.

Error co-authors:
```
Co-authored-by:
Name Surname email@example.com
```

Where it should've been:
```
Co-authored-by: Name Surname email@example.com
```
